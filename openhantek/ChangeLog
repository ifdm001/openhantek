* Replaced HantekDSOIO and HantekDSOAThread by DsoControl class
* New namespace Hantek (in directory src/hantek):
*   Added Control class (Inherits DsoControl)
*   Moved all Hantek DSO specific conversions into Control class
*   Added Device class for handling usb transfers
*   Created types.cpp/types.h with various Hantek-specific types
*   USB transfers are handled by Control class, no direct access from elsewhere
*   libusb 1.0 is used by default (Uses 0.1 when LIBUSB_VERSION is set to 0)
* DsoControl class could control non-Hantek DSOs too
* Added reference level and minimum magnitude for spectrum analysis to settings
* Made lower timebases available
* Spectrum and math graphs can be shown without enabling the voltage graph too
